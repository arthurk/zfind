Assembly filesystem searcher.

## Layout

- Sources are per-arch under `src/$(ARCH)/`; the x86-64 source is `src/x86_64/zfind.asm` (NASM).
- Build output goes to `build/$(ARCH)/`, never into the source tree.

## Symbols

Every subroutine in `src/x86_64/zfind.asm` carries an explicit ELF function
size; MAQAO, perf and debuggers attribute code through it:

```asm
    global walk_dir:function (walk_dir.end_func - walk_dir)
walk_dir:
    ...
    ret
walk_dir.end_func:
```

- The end label must sit on the function's last instruction. Code placed after
  it still assembles but is silently left out of the size, so every tool
  reports a function shorter than it really is. Moving code across that
  boundary means moving the marker.
- `$` is not an end marker: `global foo:function ($ - foo)` assembles and
  yields size 0.
- Use `.end_func`, never `.end`: NASM scopes `.name` labels to the enclosing
  function, so `foo.end` collides as soon as `foo` contains an internal `.end`.
- Shared error tails (`wfail`, `bad_*`, `big`, `scratch_full`) are jump
  targets, not functions; leave them unannotated.
- The release target strips these symbols; `make` builds keep them.

Check with `readelf -sW build/x86_64/zfind | grep ' FUNC '`.

## Build

- `nix develop` for the devshell; packages are listed in `flake.nix`.
- Assembler is NASM, linker is `ld`.
- Use the Makefile:

```sh
make           # assemble + link
make run       # build, then run
make clean
make testdata  # PRESET ?= default; see tools/mktrees.py
```

- `ARCH ?= x86_64`; `ARCH=aarch64` is a stub that errors until ported. A new
  port needs `src/<arch>/zfind.asm` plus an `ifeq` block in the Makefile.
- Extra flags pass through the variables, e.g.
  `make ASFLAGS="-f elf64 -g -DNO_EOF_SHORTCUT"`.
